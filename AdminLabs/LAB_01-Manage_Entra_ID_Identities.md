# Lab 01 - Manage Microsoft Entra ID Identities

## Lab introduction

In this lab, I have created users and assigned groups using Microsoft Entra ID.

## Lab scenario

Your organization is building a new lab environment for pre-production testing of apps and services.  A few engineers are being hired to manage the lab environment, including the virtual machines. To allow the engineers to authenticate by using Microsoft Entra ID, you have been tasked with provisioning users and groups. To minimize administrative overhead, membership of the groups should be updated automatically based on job titles.

## Key takeaways

+ A tenant represents your organization and helps you to manage a specific instance of Microsoft cloud services for your internal and external users.
+ Microsoft Entra ID has user and guest accounts. Each account has a level of access specific to the scope of work expected to be done.
+ Groups combine together related users or devices. There are two types of groups including Security and Microsoft 365.
+ Group membership can be statically or dynamically assigned.
